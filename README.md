# BTI225-WebProgrammingPrinciples

### Subject Description
This is an introductory course in web programming for standard browsers. Students begin by learning JavaScript, the programming language of the Web, and the focus of this course. Then, the Document Object Model (DOM) is studied, and with it, documents that use the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) to define their structure and content. To affect and modify the appearance and formatting of a document, students learn and apply the foundations of the Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) language. Throughout this progression of topics, JavaScript is continually used to access and modify the content and appearance of documents through the DOM interface.
